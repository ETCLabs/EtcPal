 * \brief Platform-neutral system timers.
 *
 * ```c
 * #include "etcpal/timer.h"
 * ```
 *
 * **WARNING:** This module must be explicitly initialized before use. Initialize the module by
 * calling etcpal_init() with the relevant feature mask:
 * \code
 * etcpal_init(ETCPAL_FEATURE_TIMERS);
 * \endcode
 *
 * Provides an implementation of a passive monotonic timer, as well as a way to get monotonic time
 * points. Time points and intervals are represented in milliseconds by a 32-bit unsigned int. To
 * get a time point, use etcpal_getms().
 *
 * \code
 * uint32_t time_point = etcpal_getms();
 * \endcode
 *
 * A time point represents the time elapsed in milliseconds since an arbitrary fixed point in the
 * past, independent of any changes in system "wall clock" time. Time points provided by this
 * module wrap every 4,294,967,295 milliseconds, or approximately 49.7 days. Because of this, it's
 * recommended to only use this module to time events which occur on time scales which are shorter
 * than that by at least an order of magnitude. This reduces the likelihood that wrapping will be
 * an issue.
 *
 * Note that this problem only applies to wraparound past an original time point; absolute
 * wraparound of the integer type is handled. For example, using an EtcPalTimer to time a
 * 10-millisecond interval that begins at time point 4,294,967,290 and ends at time point 5 will
 * work as expected.
 *
 * To time an interval, use an EtcPalTimer.
 *
 * \code
 * EtcPalTimer timer;
 * etcpal_timer_start(&timer, 100); // Start a 100-millisecond timer
 *
 * // Some time later...
 *
 * uint32_t elapsed = etcpal_timer_elapsed(&timer); // How many milliseconds since the timer was started
 * uint32_t remaining = etcpal_timer_remaining(&timer); // How much time is remaining in the interval
 * bool is_expired = etcpal_timer_is_expired(&timer); // Whether the interval has expired
 *
 * etcpal_timer_reset(&timer); // Reset the timer for another 100-millisecond interval
 * // Or
 * etcpal_timer_start(&timer, 1000); // Reuse the timer for a different interval, in this case 1 second.
 * \endcode

/*!
 * \brief A millisecond-resolution timer.

 * The times are represented in milliseconds by a 32-bit unsigned integer. Since the timer is
