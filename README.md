This repository contains ETC's Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL), which supports
other open-source libraries by [ETC](http://www.etcconnect.com).

ETC develops many software products which target a range of platforms from full
desktop OS down to 32-bit microcontrollers. Because of this, there is a need
for ETC's software libraries to be highly portable. The EtcPal library serves
this purpose in two main ways:

* Provides a platform-neutral interface for common system calls, in order to
  simplify the writing of platform-neutral software libraries.
* Provides a common location for utilities that are used by multiple other
  software libraries.

## Platform Ports

EtcPal is currently ported for the following platforms:
+ FreeRTOS (OS abstraction only)
+ Linux
+ lwIP (Network abstraction only)
+ macOS
+ Microsoft Windows
+ MQX

## Building

EtcPal is typically included as a dependency by other software libraries.
However, if you would like to build EtcPal on its own, there are instructions
in the [documentation](https://etclabs.github.io/EtcPal).

## About this ETCLabs Project
