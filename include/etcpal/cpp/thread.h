/// @defgroup etcpal_cpp_thread thread (Threading)
/// @ingroup etcpal_cpp
/// @brief C++ utilities for the @ref etcpal_thread module.
///
/// Provides a thread class Thread which is similar to std::thread, with the key advantage that it
/// will work on any threaded platform that EtcPal is ported for, including the embedded RTOS
/// platforms. If your application or library does not need to run on these platforms, consider
/// using std::thread instead (or in >= C++20, std::jthread, which more closely matches the
/// behavior of this class).
///
/// To start the thread with default parameters, you can use the constructor:
/// @code
/// void MyThreadFunction()
/// {
///   std::cout << "Hello from a thread!\n";
/// }
///
/// etcpal::Thread thread(MyThreadFunction); // Thread is now running
/// // Thread will be automatically joined when thread goes out of scope, or join it explicitly:
/// thread.Join();
/// @endcode
///
/// The value constructor will throw an etcpal::Error object if the thread fails to start for any
/// reason. To avoid an exception-handling approach, you can default-construct and use the Start()
/// function:
/// @code
/// etcpal::Thread thread;
/// etcpal::Error start_result = thread.Start(MyThreadFunction);
/// if (start_result)
/// {
///   // Thread is running, yay!
/// }
/// else
/// {
///   std::cout << "Error starting thread: " << start_result.ToString() << '\n';
/// }
/// @endcode
///
/// This approach also lets you set non-default thread parameters before starting; method-chaining
/// syntax is available on these setters:
/// @code
/// etcpal::Thread thread;
/// etcpal::Error start_result = thread.SetName("My Thread")
///                                     .SetPriority(4)
///                                     .SetStackSize(4000)
///                                     .Start(MyThreadFunction);
/// @endcode
///
/// Pass arguments to your thread function, which will be stored on the heap:
/// @code
/// void MyThreadFunction(int value)
/// {
///   std::cout << "The value is " << value << ".\n";
/// }
///
/// etcpal::Thread thread(MyThreadFunction, 5); // Thread will print "The value is 5."
/// @endcode
///
/// You can even use lambdas for quick-and-dirty operations:
/// @code
/// int value = 42;
/// etcpal::Thread thread([=]() { std::cout << "The value is " << value << '\n'; });
/// @endcode
///
/// The Thread class also provides static Sleep() functions, which can be used as a
/// platform-neutral sleep.
/// @code
/// etcpal::Thread::Sleep(20); // Sleep for 20 milliseconds
/// etcpal::Thread::Sleep(std::chrono::seconds(2)); // Sleep for 2 seconds
///
/// // In a C++14 or greater environment, you can also...
///
/// using namespace std::chrono_literals;
///
/// etcpal::Thread::Sleep(1min); // Sleep for 1 minute
/// @endcode
///
/// **IMPORTANT NOTE FOR RTOS USERS:** The EtcPal threading API does not initialize the scheduler
/// on real-time systems (e.g. it does not call vTaskStartScheduler() on FreeRTOS or _mqx() on
/// MQX). The application writer is responsible for managing the interaction between starting the
/// scheduler and starting EtcPal threads, just like when starting native RTOS tasks.
///
/// **IMPORTANT NOTES FOR ZEPHYR USERS:** Some EtcPal features are dependent on Zephyr configuration see: <a
/// href="targeting_zephyr.html">Targeting Zephyr</a>

/// @ingroup etcpal_cpp_thread
/// @brief A thread class, modeled after std::thread.
///
/// This class is similar to std::thread, with the key advantage that it will work on any threaded
/// platform that EtcPal is ported for, including the embedded RTOS platforms. If your application
/// or library does not need to run on these platforms, consider using std::thread instead.
///
/// There are a few differences from std::thread:
/// * The thread is automatically joined on destruction (this matches the behavior of C++20's
///   std::jthread)
/// * The thread is not _detachable_; that is, once created, it _must_ be joined before it is
///   destroyed in all cases.
/// * The thread has a Start() function - a previously default-constructed thread can be assigned
///   some operation parameters, then started, without being reassigned to another instance.
///
/// This is one of the few EtcPal wrappers that does heap allocation, as the thread function and
/// arguments need to be stored.
