Whoa, this isn't a real source file! What's going on here? Well, the headers for this module are
platform-specific, and some of them implement types and functions differently (i.e. functions as
macros, etc.), so the documentation needs somewhere to pull a standard interface from. Voila!

/**
 * @defgroup etcpal_lock lock (Locks and Synchronization)
 * @ingroup etcpal
 * @brief Platform-neutral locks, mutexes and signals.
 *
 * ```c
 * #include "etcpal/lock.h"
 * ```
 *
 * Currently provides definitions for the following synchronization primitives:
 * * Mutexes: A mutual-exclusion lock that can only be held by a single thread at a time.
 * * Signals: A method of synchronizing two or more threads around an event.
 * * Read-Write Locks: A lock which can be held either for shared or exclusive access.
 * * Counting Semaphores: A synchronization value used for tracking events that can occur multiple times.

/**
 * @defgroup etcpal_mutex Mutexes
 * @brief Mutual-exclusion (mutex) objects.
 *
 * Sometimes also referred to as a critical section. Only one thread can lock the mutex at a time
 * using etcpal_mutex_lock(). Where possible on real-time platforms, the mutex provides priority
 * inheritance.
 *
 * Mutexes are used to synchronize access to data from different threads. For example:
 * 
 * @code
 * static int shared_counter;
 * etcpal_mutex_t mutex;
 *
 * void counter_thread(void* arg)
 * {
 *   for (int i = 0; i < 10000; ++i)
 *   {
 *     // Ensure that we are the only context conducting read-modify-write operations on
 *     // shared_counter. No other thread can be in this block of code at the same time.
 *     etcpal_mutex_lock(&mutex);
 *     ++shared_counter;
 *     etcpal_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * int main(void)
 * {
 *   etcpal_mutex_create(&mutex);
 *
 *   EtcPalThreadParams thread_params = ETCPAL_THREAD_PARAMS_INIT;
 *   etcpal_thread_t thread_handles[5];
 *   for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
 *   {
 *     etcpal_thread_create(&thread_handles[i], &params, counter_thread, NULL);
 *   }
 *  
 *   // Wait for the threads to finish
 *   etcpal_thread_sleep(1000);
 *   for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
 *   {
 *     etcpal_thread_join(&thread_handles[i]);
 *   }
 *
 *   printf("The counter is: %d\n", shared_counter); // Prints "The counter is: 50000"
 *
 *   etcpal_mutex_destroy(&mutex);
 *   return 0;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * etcpal_mutex implementations use different constructs under the hood on various platforms. Also,
 * different platforms affect the behavior of certain functions.
