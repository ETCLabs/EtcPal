/* lwpa/bool.h: Provide a C boolean type for non-C99 environments. */

 *  \brief A C boolean type.
 *
 *  \#include "lwpa/bool.h"
 *
 *  In the before-times, C had no boolean type. Then, C99 gave us stdbool.h. But there still exist
 *  environments where a C99 compiler is not available or practical, and one allegedly modern
 *  toolchain (it rhymes with "Nicrosoft Fishual D++") picks and chooses the modern C features it
 *  supports seemingly at random.
 *
 *  This header attempts to detect if it is being compiled with C99 or later (or C++). If it is
 *  being compiled with C99 or later it simply includes stdbool.h. If it is being compiled with C++
 *  it does nothing (bool is a native type in C++). If none of the above are true, it creates a
 *  boolean type the old-fashioned way: \#defines.
