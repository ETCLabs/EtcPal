 *  \brief Fixed-width integer types.
 *
 *  \#include "etcpal/int.h"
 *
 *  In the before-times, C had no fixed-width integer types. Then, C99 gave us stdint.h. But there
 *  still exist environments where a C99 compiler is not available or practical, and one allegedly
 *  modern toolchain (it rhymes with "Nicrosoft Fishual D++") picks and chooses the modern C
 *  features it supports seemingly at random.
 *
 *  This header attempts to detect if it is being compiled with C99 or later (or C++). If so, it
 *  simply includes stdint.h (or cstdint). If not, it attempts to include a user-created file
 *  "stdint_usr.h" which the user provides.

/*! \def HAVE_STDINT_H
 *  \brief Define this value in your compiler settings if your toolchain provides a <stdint.h>.
 *
 *  Some compilers are non-C99 (or non-C++11) and nevertheless provide fixed-width types in
 *  <stdint.h>. In that situation, the user can define HAVE_STDINT_H to force etcpal_int to include
 *  <stdint.h>.
