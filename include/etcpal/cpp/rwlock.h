/// Provides a C++ wrappers the for EtcPal read-write lock type. Also provides RAII guard classes
/// for this type (ReadGuard and WriteGuard), which should be the primary constructs used to
/// interact with the read-write lock class.
///
/// This class is similar to std::shared_mutex, with the key advantage that they will work on any
/// threaded platform that EtcPal is ported for, including the embedded RTOS platforms. If your
/// application or library does not need to run on these platforms, consider using
/// std::shared_mutex instead.

/// @ingroup etcpal_cpp_rwlock
/// @brief A wrapper class for the EtcPal read-write lock type.
///
/// Note: The etcpal::RwLock functions are not normally used directly - prefer usage of the RAII
/// types etcpal::ReadGuard and etcpal::WriteGuard to manage locking and unlocking of an
/// etcpal::RwLock.
///
/// Example usage:
/// @code
/// class ThreadSafeCounter
/// {
/// public:
///   ThreadSafeCounter() = default;
///
///   // Multiple threads/readers can read the counter's value at the same time.
///   unsigned int get() const
///   {
///     etcpal::ReadGuard read_lock(lock_);
///     return value_;
///   }
///
///   // Only one thread/writer can increment/write the counter's value.
///   void increment()
///   {
///     etcpal::WriteGuard write_lock(lock_);
///     ++value_;
///   }
///
///   // Only one thread/writer can reset/write the counter's value.
///   void reset()
///   {
///     etcpal::WriteGuard write_lock(lock_);
///     value_ = 0;
///   }
///
///  private:
///   mutable etcpal::RwLock lock_;
///   unsigned int value_ = 0;
/// };
///
/// int main()
/// {
///   ThreadSafeCounter counter;
///
///   auto increment_and_print = [&counter]()
///   {
///     for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
///     {
///       counter.increment();
///       std::cout << counter.get() << '\n';
///     }
///   };
///
///   etcpal::Thread thread1(increment_and_print);
///   etcpal::Thread thread2(increment_and_print);
///
///   thread1.Join();
///   thread2.Join();
///
///   std::cout << counter.get() << '\n'; // Outputs '6'
